    <h1>The inside story: Why is Oh Noes so sad?</h1>
        
    <p>We had an exclusive interview with Oh Noes guy, the error buddy, and we asked him the question that all of you were wondering about: "Why do you always seem so sad?" Here's his shocking reply:</p>
    <p id="ohnoes-says"></p>
    
    <p>We asked Winston for comment, and this is all he would say about it:</p>
    <p id="winston-says"></p>

    <script>

        var ohnoesSays = document.getElementById("ohnoes-says");
        ohnoesSays.innerHTML = "Hope to become <strong> ONE </strong> of the <em> selected this time around </em>";

        var winstonSays = document.getElementById("winston-says");
        winstonSays.textContent = " I Pray to Be Lucky this time."


    </script>
