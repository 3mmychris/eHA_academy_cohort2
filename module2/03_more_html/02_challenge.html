<p>The <strong>Dog </strong>(<em>Canis familiaris</em> when considered a distinct species or <em>Canis Iupus familiaris</em> when considered a subspecies of the wolf) is a domesticaed carnivore of the family Candidae. It is part of the wolf-like Canids, and is the most widely abundant terrestrial carnivore. The dog and the extant gray wolf are sister taxa as modern wolves are not closely related to the wolves that were first domesticated, which implies that the direct ancestor of the dog is extinct.
The dog was the first species to be domesticated, and has been selectively bred over millennia for various behaviours, sensory capabilities, and physical attributes.<br>

<p>Their long association with humans has led dogs to be uniquely attuned to human behavior and they are able to thrive on a starch-rich diet that would be inadequate for other canids. Dogs vary widely in shape, size and colors. They perform many roles for humans, such as hunting, herding, pulling loads, protection, assiting police and military, companionship and, more recently, aiding disabled people and therapeutic roles. this influence on human society has given them the sobriquet of "man's best friend".</p>

<p> In 1758, the Swedish botanist and zoologist <strong>Carl Linnaeus</strong> published in his <em>Systema Nature</em> the binomial nomenclature- or the two-word naming- of species. <strong>Canis</strong> is the latin word meaning "dog", and under this genus he listed the dog-like carnivores including domestic dogs, wolves, and jackals. He classifeid the domestic dog as <em>Canis familaris</em>, and on the next page he classified the wolf as <em>Canis Iupus</em>. Linnaeus cinsidered the dog to be a separate species from the wolf because of its <strong><em>cauda recurvata-</em></strong> its upturning tail wich is not found in any other canid.</p> <br>

<p>In 1999, a study of nitochondrial DNA indicated that the domestic dog may have originated from multiple grey wolf populations, with the dingo and New Guinea singing dog "breeds" having developed at a time when human popuations were more isolated from each other. In the third edition of <strong><em>Mammal Species of the World</em></strong> published in 2005, the mammalogist <strong>W. Christopher Wozencraft</strong> listed under the wolf <em>Canis Iupus</em> its wild subspecies, and proposed two additional subsppecies.<em>"familaris</em> Linnaeus, 1758 [domestic dog]" and " dingo Meyer, 1793 [ domestic dog]". Wozencraft included <em>hallstromi</em> - the New Guinea singing dog- as a taxonomic synonym for the dingo. Wozencraft reffered to the mDNA study as one of the guides in forming his decision. The inclusion of <em>familaris</em> and <em>dingo</em> under a "domestic dog" clade has been noted by other mammalogists. This clasification by Wozencraft is debated among zoologists.</p> <br>
<p>In 2019, a workshop hosted by the IUCN/Species Survival Commissions's Canid Specialist Group considered the New Guinea singing dog and the dingo to be feral dogs <em>Canis familaris</em>, and therefore should not be assessed for the IUCN Red List.</p>

<h3 id="origin">Origin</h3>

<p>The origin of the domestic dog includes the dog"s genetic divergence from the wolf, its domestication, and its development into dog types and dog breeds. The dog is a member of the genus <em>Canis,</em> which forms part of the wolf-like canids, and was the first species and the only large carnivore to have been domesticated. Genetic studies comparing dogs with modern wolves show reciprocal monophyly (separate groups), which implies that dogs are not genetically close to any living wolf and that their wild ancestor is extinct. An extinct late <strong>Pleistocene wolf</strong> may have been the ancestor of the dog, with the dog's similarity to the extant grey wolf being the result of genetic admixture between the two. In 2020, a literature review of canid domestication stated that modern dogs were not descended from the same Canis lineage as modern wolves, and proposes that dogs may be descended from Pleistocene wolf closer in size to a village. </p><br>
 <p>The genetic divergence between dogs and wolves occurred between 20,000 and 40,000 years ago, just before or during the <strong>Late Glacial Maximum</strong> (20,000 - 27,000 years ago). This timespan represents the upper time-limit for the commencement of domestication because it is the time of divergence  and not the time of domestication, which occurred later. One of the most important transitions in human history was the domestication of animals, which began with the long-term association between wolves and hunter-gatherers more than 15,000 years ago. The archaeological record and genetic analysis show the remains of the <strong>Bonn- Oberkassel dog</strong> buried beside humans 14,200 yeaars ago to be the first undisputed dog, with disputed remains occurring 36,000 years ago.</p>
